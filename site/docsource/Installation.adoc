## Installation



### Install from NPM registries


.Prerequisites
* Standard C toolchain
* `npm` (should be installed with Node)


The standard `npm` package management tool can be used to install
BuckleScript. If you don't already have `npm` installed, follow the
directions listed
https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node[here]. Once `npm`
is installed, run the following command:

[source,sh]
------------------------------
npm install --save bs-platform
------------------------------

or install it globally

[source,shh]
------------
npm install -g bs-platform
------------

### Install from source with npm package manager

.Prerequisites:

  . Standard C toolchain
  . `npm` (should be installed with Node)

.Instructions:
[source,sh]
-----
git clone https://github.com/bloomberg/bucklescript
cd bucklescript
npm install
-----

### Install with _minimal_ dependencies

.Prerequisites:

  . Standard C toolchain


BuckleScript has very few dependencies and building from source can
easily be done.


.Build OCaml compiler


[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------------
git clone --recursive https://github.com/bloomberg/bucklescript
cd bucklescript/ocaml
./configure -prefix `pwd` # put your preferred directory
make world.opt
make install
--------------------------------------------------------

The patched compiler is installed locally into your `$(pwd)/bin`
directory. To start using it temporarily, check if `ocamlc.opt` and
`ocamlopt.opt` exist in `$(pwd)/bin`, and temporarily add the location
to your `$(PATH)` (e.g.  `PATH=$(pwd)/bin:$PATH`).

.Building BuckleScript


The following directions assume you already have the correct version of
`ocamlopt.opt` in your `$PATH`, having followed the process described in
the previous section.

[source,sh]
-----------
export BS_RELEASE_BUILD=1
make world
-----------

'''''

At the end, you should have a binary called `bsc` under `jscomp/bin`
directory, which you can add to your `$PATH`.
You could also set an environment variable
pointing to the stdlib, e.g. `BSC_LIB=/path/to/jscomp/stdlib` for ease
of use.

WARNING: The built compiler is not _relocatable_ out of box, please don't move it around unless you know what you are doing

### Introduction to OCaml ecosystem: OPAM

When working with OCaml we also recommend using https://opam.ocaml.org[opam]
package manager to install OCaml tools, available
https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html[here]. You will benefit from the
existing OCaml ecosystem.

Once you have `opam` installed, ask `opam` to switch to using our
version of the compiler:

[source,sh]
---------------------------
opam update
opam switch 4.02.3
eval `opam config env`
---------------------------
