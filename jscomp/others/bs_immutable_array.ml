type 'a t = 'a array



external from_array : 'a array -> 'a t = 
  "bs__from_array" 
(* It is like frozen, [bs__] prefix is preserved for BuckleScript, here for c stubs, we only need do a shallow copy, 
   if we introduce such type in {!Bs_dyn} it will make such ppx not easy to work, but any way, 
   we use it as a preprocessor , so we can provide another copy of {!Bs_immutable_array}
